                <p>Employment of home health aides is <b>projected to grow 48 percent from 2012 to 2022, much faster than the average for all occupations.</b> As elderly population grows, the demand for home health aides to provide assistance and companionship will continue to increase. Elderly and disabled clients increasingly rely on home care as a less expensive alternative to nursing homes or hospitals. <b>Studies have found that home treatment is often more effective than care in a nursing home or hospital.</b></p>
