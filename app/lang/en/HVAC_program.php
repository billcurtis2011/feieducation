    "career_outlook_section" => '<h2>Career Outlook</h2>
                <p><b>Employment of heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration mechanics and installers is projected to grow 21 percent from 2012 to 2022, faster than the average for all occupations.</b> Commercial and residential building construction will drive employment growth as the construction industry continues to recover from the recent recession. The growing number of sophisticated climate-control systems is also expected to increase demand for qualified HVACR technicians. Climate-control systems generally need replacement after 10 to 15 years. As a result, many homes and commercial buildings that were constructed between 2002 and 2006 will need replacement climate-control systems, further spurring demand for technicians.</p>
