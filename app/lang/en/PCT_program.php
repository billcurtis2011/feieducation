Because of the growing elderly population, many nursing aides, orderlies, and attendants will be needed in long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes. Modern medical technology also will increase the employment of nursing aides, because, as the technology saves and extends more lives, it increases the need for long-term care provided by aides.</p>
