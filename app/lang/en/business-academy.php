    "about_program_section" => "<h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>At Florida Education Institute's Business Academy, we believe that the best way to revitalize local economies is to support the entrepreneurial energy and talent that exists in every community by equipping entrepreneurs in our local communities with the tools and skills they need to grow successful businesses. When they succeed, they not only generate income for their families, but also create a ripple effect when they pay taxes, source locally and hire employees.</p>
