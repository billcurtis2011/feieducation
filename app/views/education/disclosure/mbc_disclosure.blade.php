                <h3>Occupation:</h3>
                <p>
                    The SOC code reflects the Standard Occupational Classification for Medical Billing and Coding, which is the occupation this program generally prepares students to enter. For government data regarding this and other occupations, please navigate to: <a target="_blank" href="http://online.onetcenter.org/crosswalk">http://online.onetcenter.org/crosswalk</a>
                </p>
                <h3>On Time Graduation Rate:</h3>
                <p>
                    This rate reflects the percentage of graduates in the cohort period between&nbsp;January 1st, 2010 and&nbsp;December 31, 2010&nbsp;who completed their program within 100 percent of the normal timeframe as described in the school catalog or enrollment agreement.
                </p>
                <h3>Placement Rate:</h3>
                <p>
                    Placement rate disclosed below reflects the percentage of graduates in the cohort period between January 1st, 2010 and&nbsp;December 31, 2010 who were available for employment and obtained employment in their field of study or related field after graduating from this program. Placement rates for programs are based on the requirements from our national accrediting body COE.
                </p>
                <h3>Tuition and Fees:</h3>
                <p>
                    The amounts listed herein reflect the current costs for students completing the program on time, including the estimated cost for books, supplies and fees.
                </p>
                <h3>Median Loan Debt:</h3>
                <p>
                    The median loan debt reflects the median loan debt incurred by students that have graduated from FEI programs disaggregated by loan types (i.e., Federal Student Loan, private educational loans and institutional financing plans) at the time of completion. Please keep in mind that this is a median number and the amount that will need to be borrowed will vary based on your individual circumstances. FEI always encourages their students to borrow conservatively to fund their educational goals.
                </p>
                <h3>Credit for Previous Education:</h3>
                <p>
                    Credit for courses completed at another institution for students enrolling at FEI will be subject to approval by the Registrar and/or Campus Director. These courses must adhere to the following transfer credit approval criteria: 1) Substantially similar in content and duration to those offered in the program for which the student has applied; 2) Transfer credit hours that are 5 years old or less; 3) Transfer credits with a grade of “C” or better; and 4) From an accredited institution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An official transcript from the transferring institution is required when requesting that credits be transferred to FEI. The fee to review transcripts from another institution will be a one-time charge of $250. FEI reserves the right to accept or reject any or all credits earned at other institutions. At least 70 percent of the credits required for completion of a program must be earned through instruction taken at FEI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    FEI students or graduates may transfer course work from one program into another program at FEI. The same transfer credit approval criteria (1 through 4) of this section apply for program to program transfers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All credit for previous education requests must be submitted to the Registrar by the admissions department. If credit hours for previous education are granted by FEI, then program’s duration, if necessary, will be adjusted and tuition fees prorated accordingly. The requesting student’s permanent record will be documented accordingly.
                </p>
                <h3>Transfer of Credits:</h3>
                <p>
                    Transferability of credits is at the discretion of the receiving institution. FEI cannot assure transferability of credits. It is recommended that students planning to continue their education inquire at the institution they plan to attend to determine the credits and requirements needed for entrance to that institution. It is important for students to remember that FEI’s programs are designed to prepare them for entry level employment and career opportunities.
